Hello and welcome to ***The Oracle***, your one stop shop for viewing my self-indulgent display of personal projects. As of now, I am a third year <ins> studying</ins> a Bachelor of Actuarial Studies with a Bachelor of Applied Finance. Boring, right? Some of my interests include mathematics, data science and cricket (yes, the sportüèè). Below, are some projects I have made in my downtime. Most of them are a from scratch implementation of a data science algorithm in *R*. Take a look if you are interested.
