      <description>What are decision trees? Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method. Supervised means that the input and output data is labelled. Non-parametric means that no assumptions are made regarding the assumptions of the population. This definition is obviously not that useful, but with some further consideration we can make some sense of it. Analogous to a tree in real life, a decision tree is a tree-like model of decisions.</description>
